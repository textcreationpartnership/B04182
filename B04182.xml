            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The EARL of LOTHIAN'S SPEECH TO THE General Aſſembly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Right Reverend Miniſters and Elders of this General Aſſembly,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall not take up your Time with any thing concerning my ſelf, being ſenſible of ſo many Natural Unfitneſſes for the Character I bear, that it were no little Diſingenuity, to endeavour by an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to extenuate them; But being very unexpectedly Commanded by the King, whoſe Orders I Diſpute not, to meet you at this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, I chooſed rather to expoſe my Reputation which hitherto I have been tender enough of, with this Diſadvantage to come after a Perſon ſo well Qualified and Fitted for this Affair; then to decline any thing wherein His Majeſty may think I could in the leaſt be Serviceable to Him, or have any Proſpect of being any manner of way Inſtrumental in ſettling the Peace of the Church, which hath for ſo long a time been Rent, without any great appearance hitherto of an effectual ways for its Healing.</p>
            <p>And indeed the known Inclinations of His Majeſty to go the greateſt length can conſiſt with Royalty, to effectuate ſo good a Work, are no leſs Encouragements to your Well-wiſhers, then they ſhould be Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make you go all the Lengths and Advances on your parts, that ſuch a Pious and Proteſtant King deserves at your Hands, who is willing to do more voluntarly, than what could ever be extorted from His Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, even in their loweſt Condition; And which can in Reaſon never be expected from any ſhall ſucceed in the Royal Throne. But as no leſs was to be look'd for from the Return of your Prayers, and your ſincere Endeavours in the work of the Miniſtry in the midſt of ſharpeſt Tryals, than the bleſſing of ſuch a King, your Deliverer, who in following the Steps of his Renowned and Noble Predeceſſors the Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Bulwark and Deliverers of the Proteſtant Intereſt throughout the world, hath now in a manner put it in your own Hands, to ſettle the Peace, and Unity of our Church; ſo upon the other hand, if there ſhould be any Shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Remiſneſs in coming up the length to give His Majeſty a ſutable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as it will be juſtly thought by your Friends, a Stroke from Heaven, from hidden Cauſes of GODS unſearchable Decrees, as the Deſtruction of the Primitive Churches were; So the Opportunity loſt, will be an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Rejoicing to your Enemies, probably not to be regained. But I ſhall wiſh and hope for better things from this Reverend and Wiſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, who have in your own Hands, to make your ſelves a more general one, by uniting the Church, removing Error and Scandal, ſtopping the Mouths of your Adverſaries, and make the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> more Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous than any Church, or Church-men I know, who in no Age were much commended for Charity towards their Brethren; though no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Duty is ſo much recommended by Holy Scripture.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:174483:2"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 66 -->
            <p>There is one thing I cannot forbear to mention, much talk'd of, being much in the Heads, and in Controverſie in this Age, which is <hi>Church-Government,</hi> and which I cannot deny to be Material, it being the Hedge about the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, without which the tender Plants cannot be raiſed, neither the mature Fruit well preſerved; Yet in compariſon of ſeveral others, it appears not to be of ſo great Conſequence, being that which ſo many Learned, Pious and Orthodox Divines differ ſo much upon, who would ſuffer Martyrdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would yield to <hi>Points,</hi> that make not ſo great Noiſe, and tho that <hi>Fence</hi> be of very good uſe, it cannot be ſuppoſed, it is raiſed to keep out Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourers, who are willing to work in the Vineyard; <hi>Since thoſe came in the laſt hour, were made equal with thoſe that came in at the firſt hour, who had born the burden, and heat of the day;</hi> So it would ſeem reaſonable, that ſince the Biſhops, who were look'd upon as your Perſecutors, being laid aſide by Act of Parliament, and of whom, tho it cannot be ſaid, they did come up the length of the Piety, or Moral Virtues, of thoſe Biſhops of the Primitive Times, or of thoſe in our Neighbour Nation of <hi>England,</hi> who have given ſo recent a Teſtimony of their Faithfulneſs; Yet that ſhould be no hinderance, why thoſe ſhould not be cordially received into the Government, who are already in the Exerciſe of the more Eſſentials, with this double Advantage, both to ſtrengthen you conſiderably, and leave the others without ſo much as the hopes of either Party, or Abettors.</p>
            <p>What can after this be the Grounds of rational Apprehenſions or Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies? Since Epiſcopacy is now Aboliſhed, and Presbytary Eſtabliſhed by an Act of Parliament, which his Majeſty ſince, hath given repeated Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not to alter; Sure then the moſt Prudent, whereof, I am perſwaded, there are many in this Grave and Wiſe Aſſembly, will not ſtand upon Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties and Punctilio's, ſo extrinſick to Men of your Profeſſion, which even to Laicks, Princes or States, where Points of Honour have got ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Footing upon, are at beſt but blameable Formalities, which neither anſwers the Laws of GOD, nor Men; nor Biggottry, which I hope, you need not be guarded againſt, though incident to Church-Men; And the Character of the Erroneous, is found to be oftneſt lodged in the narroweſt Heads and Capacities, and frequently miſtaken for Zeal.</p>
            <p>But I forbear, being loath to take up your time; Only this, that I think it a Stretch to Reaſon, to comprehend how Royal Authority, in a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant King, can Claſh with a Proteſtant Church, in his own Dominions, no Articles of Faith being controverted; So I ſhall only lay before you, what His Majeſty, with ſo much Reaſon expects, and which both your Friends and Enemies, looks upon with ſuch different Eyes and Expectations, and is, what I ſuppoſe, your real Intereſt, in the firſt place, cheerfully to receive your Brethren with open Arms, who are willing to Join, and who have never been made appear to be either Scandalous or Erroneous, and who are ready to ſubmit to the Government, and leave thoſe things of ſmaller moment, until that great Bleſſing of a Chriſtian Charitable Union be perfected, without which, all endeavours elſe, will be to ſmall purpoſe; But upon the other hand, if there ſhall be any Miniſters, that Preached under Epiſcopacy, ſhould now have any Remiſneſs to imbrace the Offer of your accepting of them as it will diſcover what Spirits they are of, and what Meaſures ſhould be taken, ſo it ſhould not retard, nor render ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; thoſe who freely offer themſelves.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall hope, that henceforth, the only Endeavour ſhall be, in an holy Emulation, who ſhall ſhew moſt readineſs, to be Unite; That they may join their Labours, in the work of the Miniſtry; And that my part may on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be that of a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> with the Satisfaction of having the Honour to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Majeſty of what I am confident he will be very well pleaſed with.</p>
